                                I transition my career from Software Engineer to Product Management because it perfectly aligns with my entrepreneurial mindset, which I've nurtured since my college days. 
                                During my studies, I was always drawn to creating solutions for real-world problems, leading project teams, and driving innovative ideas from concept to execution.

                                        After conversing with university students, I discovered that they face challenges in keeping track of assignment deadlines, finding information about campus events, and locating available part-time on-campus jobs and internships. To address these issues, I conducted a survey to gather more insights and decided to develop a comprehensive solution.
                                        I began drafting a strategy to build an app aimed at creating a strong student community and providing a centralized platform for managing various needs, such as assignment reminders, event RSVPs, and career opportunities. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        To make the portal more engaging, I incorporated innovative features like rewarding students with campus digital points, which can be used in the marketplace to buy food and books with special coupon discounts.

                                        After launching an MVP of the product, I collected extensive feedback from users and made necessary improvements based on their suggestions. Currently, I am working on expanding this product to other campuses, aiming to build a viable intra-college community where students can share ideas, network, and learn from each other.
